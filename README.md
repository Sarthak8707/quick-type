# Typing Speed Test (React + TypeScript)

A typing speed test web application built with **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite**.  
The app measures typing speed (WPM) by starting a timer when the user begins typing and locking input once time expires.

- 📊 Words Per Minute (WPM) calculation

## 🧠 How It Works

- User starts typing → timer begins
- A **60-second countdown** runs (configurable)
- Typed text is stored in state until time expires
- After timeout:
  - Input is ignored
  - WPM is calculated
  - Result is displayed
